BuddyPress Groups CiviCRM Sync
==============================

**Please note:** this is the development repository for *BuddyPress Groups CiviCRM Sync*. The plugin is also available in [the WordPress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-groups-civicrm-sync/), which is the best place to get it from if you're not a developer.

The *BuddyPress Groups CiviCRM Sync* plugin provides two-way synchronisation between *CiviCRM* and *BuddyPress* groups in a similar way to the Drupal *Organic Groups CiviCRM* module. Existing groups in *CiviCRM* that were generated by the Drupal *Organic Groups CiviCRM* module can be migrated to become *BuddyPress*-compatible *CiviCRM* groups.

For each *BuddyPress* group, the plugin will automatically create two *CiviCRM* groups:

* A "normal" (mailing list) group containing a contact record for each corresponding *BuddyPress* group member. This group is assigned the same name as the linked *BuddyPress* group.
* An "ACL" group containing the contact record of the administrators of the corresponding *BuddyPress* group. This gives *BuddyPress* group admins the ability to view and edit members of their group in *CiviCRM*.

When a new user is added to (or joins) a *BuddyPress* group, they are automatically added to the corresponding *CiviCRM* group. Likewise, when a contact is added to the "normal" *CiviCRM* group, they will be added as a member to the corresponding *BuddyPress* group. If a contact is added to the *CiviCRM* "ACL" group, they will be added to the *BuddyPress* group as an administrator.

#### Notes ####

This plugin requires a minimum of *WordPress 3.9*, *BuddyPress 1.8* and *CiviCRM 4.6*. If you also have group hierarchies, then it also requires a minimum of *BP Group Hierarchy 1.3.9*.
