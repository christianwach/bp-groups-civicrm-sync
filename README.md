BuddyPress Groups CiviCRM Sync
==============================

The *BuddyPress Groups CiviCRM Sync* plugin provides two-way synchronisation between *CiviCRM* and *BuddyPress* groups in a similar way to the Drupal *Organic Groups CiviCRM* module. Existing groups in *CiviCRM* that were generated by the Drupal *Organic Groups CiviCRM* module can be migrated to become *BuddyPress*-compatible *CiviCRM* groups.

For each *BuddyPress* group, the plugin will automatically create two *CiviCRM* groups:

* A "normal" (mailing list) group containing a contact record for each corresponding *BuddyPress* group member. This group is assigned the same name as the linked *BuddyPress* group.
* An "ACL" group containing the contact record of the administrators of the corresponding *BuddyPress* group. This gives *BuddyPress* group admins the ability to view and edit members of their group in *CiviCRM*.

When a new user is added to (or joins) a *BuddyPress* group, they are automatically added to the corresponding *CiviCRM* group. Likewise, when a contact is added to the "normal" *CiviCRM* group, they will be added as a member to the corresponding *BuddyPress* group. If a contact is added to the *CiviCRM* "ACL" group, they will be added to the *BuddyPress* group as an administrator.

#### Notes ####

This plugin requires a minimum of *WordPress 3.9*, *BuddyPress 1.8* and *CiviCRM 4.6-alpha1*. If you also have group hierarchies, then it also requires a minimum of *BP Group Hierarchy 1.3.9*.

For versions of *CiviCRM* prior to 4.6-alpha1, this plugin requires the corresponding branch of the [CiviCRM WordPress plugin](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress) plus the custom WordPress.php hook file from the [CiviCRM Hook Tester repo on GitHub](https://github.com/christianwach/civicrm-wp-hook-tester) so that it overrides the built-in *CiviCRM* file. Please refer to the each repo for further instructions.

#### Installation ####
